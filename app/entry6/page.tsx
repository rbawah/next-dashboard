                  This conversation with Tenzin Priyadarshi reshaped my perspective on ethics in engineering, emphasizing the need to embed <b>ethical considerations</b> before development, not only through post-deployment adjustments.

                <li>
                  I found his critique of over-relying on metrics powerful, as it highlights that <b>quantifying everything overlooks qualitative values</b> like empathy and kindnessâ€”elements often difficult to measure but essential in ethical technology.
                </li>
                <li>
                  His distinction between intelligence and wisdom resonated with me, urging me to consider that efficient algorithms alone aren't enough; fostering systems that reflect <b>human values</b> is critical.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This insight reminded me of a past project where <b>prioritizing performance</b> metrics over user-centered values led to a less effective outcome. In the future, I plan to incorporate more <b>diverse perspectives</b> early in the design phase to achieve a balance between technical efficiency and ethical responsibility, focusing on the societal impact of technology.
